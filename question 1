Passenger objects are stored as pointers in the TicketReservationSystem class to enhance memory management and operational efficiency. Using pointers allows dynamic allocation and deallocation of memory, ensuring that resources are utilized only when needed. This approach prevents unnecessary duplication of large objects and simplifies the systemâ€™s handling of polymorphic behavior, such as when dealing with subclasses of the Passenger class. By storing references instead of entire objects, the system maintains flexibility, supports easier updates or modifications, and ensures a scalable and maintainable design for managing passenger information.
